## Theory
Electromigraphic signals are small potentials appearing on the surface of the skin during muscle work. These are frequencies of 500 Hz with low amplitude. The value of bioelectric voltages is around a dozen nV, so it is necessary to amplify the recorded signal. Electrical signals are generated during intentional or uncontrolled muscle contraction.
The excitatory impulse comes from the nervous system. The muscle fiber is stimulated by an impulse from the synapse, resulting in the depolarization of the action potential, which spreads across the muscle fiber membrane.
Due to the size of the measuring electrode applied to the skin surface, we collect information from more than one motor unit. The recorded signal is the resultant value of the action potentials of motor units from the area adjacent to the electrode.
